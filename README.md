# LEARNING-DISTRIBUTED-WORD-AND-NODE-REPRESENTATIONS
Word2Vec ,Node2Vec ,Fasttext

In this project, you will learn about various techniques for learning vector representations of logical objects like words in a sentence and nodes in a graph. More specifically, you will start by implementing the popular word2vec model and then implement a closely related model known as node2vec for graphs
This repository Contains 4 notebooks

1. Word2Vec : This notebook contains the implementation of simple word2vec model without any optimization
2. Word2Vec_NegativeSampling: This Notebook conatins theimplementation of  word2vec model with negative sampling .
3. Node2Vec: Implementation of Node2Vec with random walk
4. FastText_Word2Vec : Comparison of FastText model and Word2Vec model
